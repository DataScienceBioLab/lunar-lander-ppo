# Lunar Lander Behavior Analysis and Improvement Plan

## Current Status Summary

After running extensive grid searches and analyzing the landing behavior of various models, we've identified critical issues with our current approach:

1. **Landing Success Rate**: 
   - Initial models: 0% success rate despite high rewards reported during training (up to 109.18)
   - Stage 1 extreme landing focus model: 23.3% success rate (7 successful landings out of 30 episodes)

2. **Observed Behaviors**:
   - Top-performing models show better thruster control and orientation management
   - Many models tend to float/hover rather than commit to landing
   - Some models crash with high velocity or incorrect orientation
   - Some models learned to stay aloft to avoid penalties from crashing

3. **Reward Function Issues**:
   - Initial reward structure didn't sufficiently prioritize landing completion
   - Penalties for velocity, fuel usage, and position were overwhelming the landing reward
   - Models were optimizing for survival time rather than successful landing
   - Our extreme landing focus adjustments have shown improvement (23.3% success vs 0%)

## Latest Findings (Stage 1 Implementation)

Our analysis of the stage 1 extreme landing focus model reveals:

1. **Success Criteria Breakdown**:
   - Position criterion failures: Many landings occurred outside the designated area (Â±0.2 range)
   - Velocity criterion failures: Some landings had final velocities above the 0.5 threshold
   - Angle criterion failures: Some landings had final angles above the 0.2 radian threshold

2. **Success Patterns**:
   - Successful landings achieved very low velocities (often 0.00) and angles (0.00-0.01)
   - Position control remains challenging even in successful landings

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Successful landings had rewards ranging from -48.7 to -132.4
   - Many failed landings had better rewards than successful ones, indicating reward misalignment

## Progressive Training Approach (Updated)

Our staged approach focuses on solving the landing problem incrementally.

### Stage 1: Focus on Landing (Any Landing) - CURRENT STAGE
- **Primary Goal**: Train the agent to land safely, regardless of position or efficiency
- **Success Metric**: >75% of episodes end with the lander touching down safely (upright, low velocity)
- **Current Status**: Progressive strategies failed (0% success). Multiplicative strategies achieved up to ~32% success in Run 1 & 2, showing promise but still below target.

### Stage 2: Landing Accuracy
- **Primary Goal**: Land precisely on the landing pad
- **Success Metric**: >75% of episodes end with successful landings on the pad
- **Prerequisites**: Must first achieve Stage 1 success metrics

### Stage 3: Efficient Landing
- **Primary Goal**: Optimize fuel usage while maintaining landing success
- **Success Metric**: Maintain >75% landing success rate while reducing average fuel consumption
- **Prerequisites**: Must first achieve Stage 2 success metrics

## Updated Reward Function Recommendations

For Stage 1 (Landing Focus) - Refined based on results:

```python
{
    "landing_reward_scale": 15.0,       # Further increase landing reward (was 10.0)
    "velocity_penalty_scale": 0.2,      # Further reduce velocity penalties (was 0.3)
    "angle_penalty_scale": 0.5,         # Further reduce angle penalties (was 0.7)
    "distance_penalty_scale": 0.0,      # Remove distance penalties entirely to prevent hovering (was 0.1)
    "fuel_penalty_scale": 0.0,          # Keep fuel penalties at zero (unchanged)
    "safe_landing_bonus": 300.0,        # Significantly increase landing bonus (was 200.0)
    "min_flight_steps": 30,             # Ensure minimum flight time before landing
    "landing_velocity_threshold": 0.6,  # Slightly increase threshold to allow more landings
    "landing_angle_threshold": 0.25     # Slightly increase threshold to allow more landings
}
```

## Overnight Run 1 Results (Progressive vs. Multiplicative)

Based on the failure of the refined progressive strategies (`baseline_progressive_v3`, `prog_extreme_*`) to achieve any successful landings (0% success rate), we conducted an overnight batch exploring more fundamental reward changes, primarily focusing on a **multiplicative reward strategy**.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **Progressive Failure Confirmed:** Runs using extremely high additive bonuses/scales (`prog_extreme_*`) still resulted in 0% success, confirming that simply scaling the previous approach was insufficient.
2.  **Multiplicative Strategy Success:** Several configurations using the multiplicative reward (`base_reward * safety_mult * accuracy_mult * ...`) achieved significant success rates, reaching **up to 32%** on certain seeds. This validates the hypothesis that making landing a prerequisite for *any* large reward is effective.
3.  **Base Reward Sensitivity:**
    *   Base rewards of 1k and 2.5k showed good success (up to 32%).
    *   5k base reward was slightly less successful (max 22%).
    *   10k and 100k base rewards performed poorly or inconsistently (0-32% with high variance), suggesting potential instability even with very low learning rates.
    *   Optimal range appears to be 1k-5k.
4.  **PPO Clip Parameter:** Reducing `clip_param` from 0.2 to 0.15 showed a notable improvement (18% -> 30% success) on one of the successful multiplicative configurations (`mult_b2k5_sExp_aGauss_lr5e5`), suggesting tighter policy updates are beneficial.
5.  **Seed Variability:** Results showed significant variance based on the random seed, highlighting the need for multiple runs to confirm performance.

**Conclusion from Run 1:** The multiplicative reward structure is clearly superior for achieving initial landing success. Future efforts should focus on optimizing this structure and related hyperparameters.

## Overnight Run 2 Results (Multiplicative Strategy Optimization)

This run focused on optimizing the promising multiplicative reward strategy identified in Run 1.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **Multiplicative Strategy Consistency:** Re-running top performers from Run 1 confirmed consistent (though variable) success rates in the **18-26%** range, validating the general approach.
2.  **Base Reward Range (1k-5k):** Runs with base rewards of 1k, 1.5k, 2.5k, 3.5k, and 5k all achieved success rates peaking between **18-30%**. This confirms 1k-5k as the effective range. Higher rewards (10k+) remained unstable or ineffective.
3.  **Multiplier Combination Performance:**
    *   The combination of **Linear Safety** and **Gaussian Accuracy** (`sLin_aGauss`) achieved a peak success rate of **28%** on one seed.
    *   **Exponential Safety** and **Gaussian Accuracy** (`sExp_aGauss`) remained strong, peaking at **26%** (and 30% for the 5k base reward run).
    *   Combinations using Linear Accuracy (`sExp_aLin`) or No Accuracy (`sExp_aNone`) performed significantly worse (12-16%).
    *   **Conclusion:** Gaussian accuracy multiplier seems crucial. Both Linear and Exponential safety multipliers work well when combined with Gaussian accuracy.
4.  **Clip Parameter Result:** Explicit tests of `clip_param=0.1` and `0.15` performed poorly (10%) compared to the default of `0.2` used in the successful base runs (18-26%). The apparent improvement seen in Run 1 was likely an anomaly or setup error. Default `clip_param=0.2` is preferred.
5.  **Seed Variability:** Variance between seeds remained noticeable (e.g., 18% vs 26% for `mult_b2k5_sExp_aGauss_lr5e5`).

**Conclusion from Run 2:** The multiplicative strategy is robust within the 1k-5k base reward range. The `sLin_aGauss` and `sExp_aGauss` multiplier combinations are the most effective identified so far. The default PPO clip parameter is best. Success rates are still below the Stage 1 target, suggesting longer training or further minor tweaks might be needed.

## Implementation Plan (Overnight Run 3 - In Progress)

Based on Run 2 results, this run focuses on longer training for the best combinations:

1.  **Target Configurations:** Test the 8 combinations of [Base Reward: 2.5k, 5k] x [Safety Mult: Lin, Exp] x [Accuracy Mult: Gauss, Lin].
2.  **Longer Training:** Increase `max_episodes` to 8000 to see if performance improves with more time.
3.  **Consistent Hyperparams:** Use fixed `learning_rate=5e-5` and `clip_param=0.2`.
4.  **Goal:** Identify if longer training pushes success rates closer to the 75% target and determine the best overall configuration from Run 2.

## Next Experimental Configurations (Post Run 3)

1.  **Analyze Run 3:** Evaluate success rates and learning curves from the 8k episode runs.
2.  **Select Best Overall Stage 1:** Choose the configuration with the highest *and* most stable success rate across seeds from Run 3.
3.  **Analyze Behavior:** Review landing videos/plots for the best Run 3 models. Assess positional accuracy.
4.  **Plan Stage 2:** If success rate is sufficiently high (ideally >50-60%, even if not 75%) and landings are somewhat centered, begin designing Stage 2 rewards by modifying the accuracy multiplier (e.g., smaller Gaussian sigma) or adding small additive positional terms.
5.  **Consider Longer Training/Architecture:** If Run 3 still doesn't reach high success rates, consider even longer runs (10k+ episodes) or potentially slightly larger network architectures for the best config.

Remember: Our three progressive goals are:
1. Land more often (exploration)
2. Land better (positional accuracy)
3. Use less fuel (efficiency)

We will not pursue goals 2 and 3 until we have significantly improved our success rate on goal 1.
