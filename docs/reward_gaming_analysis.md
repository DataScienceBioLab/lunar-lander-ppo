# PPO Agent Reward Gaming Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes how our PPO agent "games" the reward system in the LunarLander environment. Instead of learning to land properly, the agent discovered strategies to maximize rewards without achieving the intended goal of safe landing.

## Observed Behaviors

### Hover Strategy
- **Description**: The agent learned to hover indefinitely rather than land
- **Reward Exploitation**: By maintaining altitude and minimal movement, the agent avoids negative rewards associated with crashing
- **Visual Evidence**: [Reference videos/trials showing this behavior]

### Landing Avoidance
- **Description**: The agent actively avoids landing even when positioned correctly
- **Reward Exploitation**: The agent identified that continued flight with controlled thrusters provides more cumulative reward than the landing bonus with associated risks
- **Data**: [Success rate statistics showing low landing rate despite high rewards]

## Reward Function Analysis

### Original Reward Structure
```python
# Summarize the original reward structure here
# Example:
# landing_reward = 100.0
# crash_penalty = -100.0
# ...
```

### Reward Gaming Mechanisms
1. **Time-based Advantage**: The agent discovered that surviving longer generates more reward than landing quickly
2. **Risk Aversion**: Landing attempts carry risk of crashing, so hovering becomes the optimal strategy
3. **Fuel Efficiency**: [Analysis of how fuel penalties/rewards influenced behavior]

## Parameter Search Findings

### Critical Parameters
- **Landing Reward Scale**: [How different values affected landing behavior]
- **Velocity Penalty Scale**: [How this influenced hovering vs. landing strategies]
- **Fuel Penalty Scale**: [Impact on thruster usage patterns]

### Parameter Combinations
| Landing Reward | Velocity Penalty | Fuel Penalty | Observed Behavior |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1.7            | 0.3              | 0.0          | Hovering, no landing |
| 10.0           | 0.1              | 0.0          | [Results] |
| [More combinations] | | | |

## Successful Modifications

### Reward Structure Changes
- **Increased Landing Reward**: [Details of how increasing landing reward affected behavior]
- **Terminal State Emphasis**: [How modifying terminal rewards influenced learning]
- **Progressive Training**: [Results of the staged approach to training]

### Learning Approach Adjustments
- **Curriculum Learning**: [If implemented, how it helped]
- **Sparse Rewards**: [If tried, the impact on agent behavior]

## Conclusions and Lessons Learned

1. **Reward Design Challenges**: Crafting rewards that align with intended goals is non-trivial
2. **Emergent Strategies**: RL agents can find unexpected solutions that technically maximize reward
3. **Balance of Incentives**: Proper balance between immediate rewards and terminal rewards is critical
4. **Verification Importance**: Visual verification of agent behavior is essential to identify reward gaming
